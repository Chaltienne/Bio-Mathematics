 Measles is a highly contagious, serious airborne disease caused by a virus that can
 lead to severe complications and death (World Health Organization). Mathematical
 modeling plays a crucial role in understanding the transmission dynamics of the
 virus and assessing the impact of control strategies, particularly vaccination and
 immunity acquired after infection.
 In this study, we develop and analyze a compartmental epidemiological model
 that includes several population groups: susceptible (S) individuals, infected (I)
 individuals, recovered (R) individuals, vaccinated (V ) individuals, and the envi
ronment (host of measles virus) (D) individuals. We examine the mathemat
ical properties of the model by establishing its positivity and boundedness,
 determining the disease- free and endemic equilibrium points, and computing
 the basic reproduction number (R0). Additionaly, we conduct a stability anal
ysis to understand the conditions for measles eradication and perform a sensitivity
 analysis to identify the most inuential parameters a ecting infection dynamics,
 we conduct numerical simulations using assumed variables, parameter val
ues and interpret the results and conduct an optimal control analysis of the
 model.
